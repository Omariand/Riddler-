    #2 minutes for a guess, 1st guess takes off 10 seconds, 2nd takes off 20 seconds
    #3rd is 30 seconds. after 3rd guess every guess is 30 seconds
    

    #loop - would be inside the guessing and the time
    #loop - for the riddle (repeating the riddle)
    #if statement - if guess is correct, winner moves to next round
    #next round function - play game, rules, winner function
